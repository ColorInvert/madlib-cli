How to use your library (where applicable)
Tests

    How do you run tests?
    pytest, using a template set of tests provided for this assignment. The file structure is a bit of a mess, as I may have misconfigured the positioning of the tests and the actual program. I did ensure that my program does pass the function tests required however.
    Any tests of note?
    Making sure a text file is read, making sure it is parsed, making sure that a file read error is successfully thrown as a result of a try/except block failure condition, and correct output.
    Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc
    Provided tests are the only ones completed.
